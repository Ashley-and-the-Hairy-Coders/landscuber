Summary of App:
This app is built in order to serve two crowds a Customer and a Service Provider.  LandScuber is an uber-like app targeting the landscaping industry.  The general idea is for Customers to be able to request on demand Service Providers in their local area to provide landscaping services for a pre-determined price.  Upon complete of service Customers are able to rate the job completed by the Service Provider.

Tech Highlights:
Integration with Auth0 for secure login.
Utilizing Sockets we created a live chat that allows the Customer and Service Provider to communicate instantly during the duration of the service period eliminating the need an exchange of personal information.
The Service Provider can get directions provided by Google Maps isntantly through the Job page.
Live status updates are provided through all stages of the job from intitalizatin through acceptance to completion.

Technologies Used:
On the front-end LandScuber was built using Vue.js, Bootstrap, Sass, JQuery, Popper.js, Sweetalert2, Vuex and Axios.
On the back-end we used Node.js, Express, Socket.io, Mongoose, and MongoDB
We integrated Auth0 to manage authentication services, and are hosted on Heroku.
